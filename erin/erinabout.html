<p> Erin Nene-Lee Ramirez is a filmmaker and an award-winning visual artist. Originally
from New Hampshire, Erin moved to Los Angeles to pursue cinematic arts and
journalism at the University of Southern California. His most recent work, La Guerra,
follows a young, adolescent woman who takes on new responsibilities after facing her
parentsâ€™ deportation. The story highlights a unique narrative that is increasingly becoming
more common-- the story of young Latino Americans whose lives are being dramatically
altered by our current political climate. His stories examine current social issues and the
commonality of human experience, with a particular focus on unearthing narratives from
frequently underrepresented populations in the media.</p>
